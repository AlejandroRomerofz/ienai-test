# Ienai Space Technical Test

This is a technical test project created using **Next.js** and **Material UI** as part of a skills assessment for **Ienai Space**. The project consists of two main features:

1. A table with pagination, filters, and static data.
2. A Python playground compatible with Plotly to display interactive graphs.

## Features

- **Table Component**: A fully functional table with pagination, filtering, and static data display.
- **Python Playground**: A Python environment where you can execute code and generate plots using Plotly.

## Installation & Setup

To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Finally, start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Python Playground Setup

For the Python playground to work correctly, you need to create a virtual environment and install the required Python dependencies.

1. Run the following command to create the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   npm run venv
   ```

2. This will set up the Python environment and install the necessary dependencies for the playground, including **Plotly** for graph generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** for the React framework.
- **Material UI** for the UI components.
- **Python** for the playground and Plotly graphing.

## How to Use

- **Table**: Interact with the table by applying filters and navigating through the paginated data.
- **Python Playground**: Write and execute Python code to generate interactive plots using Plotly. The environment is pre-configured for this purpose.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to build full-stack applications using Next.js and Material UI, as well as my understanding of integrating external technologies like Python for interactive features.

Feel free to explore and test the application.
